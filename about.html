              One early morning before the start of school, a group of students were talking about their dreams and aspirations. It
              was there that they all realized that it is not too early to start making their way towards their dreams, and it was at
              that moment, that AlphaLocke was born. To these students, AlphaLocke is an organization in which they can as a collective
              whole demonstrate their capabilities to colleges, universities, and future employers.
